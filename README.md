# Chatbot-Langchain
This project builds a custom chatbot using Langchain, FAISS, and Hugging Face embeddings. It extracts technical course data from a website, generates embeddings, stores them in FAISS, and exposes a Flask RESTful API. Users can send questions and receive relevant answers based on the course data.
